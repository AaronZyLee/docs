## Display a map

First, make sure you've provisioned a map resource by running `amplify add geo`, selecting the **Map (visualize the geospatial data)** option and running `amplify push` to deploy

To render a map, the [MapLibre GL](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js) library and the `maplibre-gl-js-amplify` package is required. MapLibre GL is an open source map rendering library for JavaScript. `maplibre-gl-js-amplify` is a library that makes it easy to integration MapLibre with Amplify Geo.

Add the dependencies to your app:

```bash
npm install -S maplibre-gl maplibre-gl-js-amplify
Add maplibre-gl-js-amplify to your app with `yarn` or `npm`:

```bash
npm install -S maplibre-gl-js-amplify
```
[maplibre-gl-js-amplify](https://github.com/aws-amplify/maplibre-gl-js-amplify) is a library that makes it easy to integration MapLibre with Amplify Geo.

In your appâ€™s entry point i.e. `App.js`, import and load the configuration file `aws-exports.js` which has been created and replaced into `/src` folder in the previous step.
```javascript
import Amplify from 'aws-amplify';
import { AmplifyMapLibreRequest } from "maplibre-gl-js-amplify";
import { Map } from "maplibre-gl";
import awsconfig from './aws-exports';

Amplify.configure(awsconfig);
```

In your app create an async function to call [AmplifyMapLibreRequest's](https://github.com/aws-amplify/maplibre-gl-js-amplify/blob/main/API.md#amplifymaplibrerequest) function `createMapLibreMap` to create a new instance of maplibre-gl [Map](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js-docs/api/map/).
```javascript
async function initializeMap() {
    const map = await AmplifyMapLibreRequest.createMapLibreMap({
        container: "map", // An HTML Element or HTML element ID to render the map in https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js-docs/api/map/
        center: [-123.1187, 49.2819],
        zoom: 11,
        region: "us-west-2"
    })
}

initializeMap();
```

## Display markers on map

To display markers on a map, use the [drawPoints](https://github.com/aws-amplify/maplibre-gl-js-amplify/blob/main/API.md#drawpoints) function. `drawPoints` expects:

- `sourceName` - specifies the layer on which the markers are rendered on. You can edit existing markers by passing the same `sourceName`
- coordinate data - the coordinate data of the markers to be displayed
- a maplibre-gl-js Map - the map object on which to render the markers

<amplify-callout>

The `drawPoints` method returns an object containing the string ids of the source and layers used to create the points on the map. These ids can be used to add any additional customizations through maplibre-gl-js [source](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js-docs/api/sources/), [paint](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js-docs/style-spec/layers/#paint-property), and [layer](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js-docs/style-spec/layers/) options.

</amplify-callout>

```javascript
map.on("load", function () {
    drawPoints("mySourceName", // Arbitrary source name
        [[-123.1187, 49.2819], [-122.849, 49.1913]], // Any coordinate or Feature data
        map,
        {
            showCluster: true,
            unclusteredOptions: {
                showMarkerPopup: true,
            },
            clusterOptions: {
                showCount: true,
            },
        }
    );
});

```

## Display different map styles

The `getAvailableMaps` api will fetch information for all maps that are available to be displayed.

In the context of Amazon Location Service maps, it will fetch the map name and the style of all maps that were generated using the Amplify CLI. This is useful is you would like to give your users a variety of maps styles to choose from.

```javascript
geo.getAvailableMaps();
```

This will return an array of maps that are available:

```javascript
//returns
[
  {
    mapName: 'myAmplifyGeoErsiStreetMap',
    style: 'VectorEsriStreets'
  },
  {
    mapName: 'myAmplifyGeoErsiTopographicMap',
    style: 'VectorEsriStreetsVectorEsriTopographic'
  },
]
```

Then given you have an existing maplibre-gl Map you can use the `setStyle` and `resize` functions to update the displayed map

```javascript
map.setStyle("myAmplifyGeoErsiTopographicMap"); // map name received from getAvailableMaps()
map.resize(); // forces the map to re-render
```
