## Maps with Amplify

AWS Amplify Storage module provides a simple mechanism for managing user content for your app in public, protected or private storage buckets. The Storage category comes with built-in support for Amazon S3.

There are two ways to add storage with Amplify - manual and automated. Both methods require the `auth` category with Amazon Cognito to also be enabled. If you are creating an S3 bucket from scratch, you should use the **Automated Setup**. However if you are reusing existing Cognito and S3 resources, you should opt for **Manual Setup**.
