## Provisioning resources

The primary way to provision Geo resources is through the Amplify CLI. Currently, you need to install the CLI with the `@geo` tag in order to get the Geo functionality. You can use the following command to install this version globally.

```
npm i -g @aws-amplify/cli@geo
```

Once that is complete, you can run the following command from your project's root folder to add a `geo` resource:

```
amplify add geo
```
